## Getting Started

First open the folder you want to download this repo into.

Then run 

```
git clone https://github.com/zgordon/gatsby-basics.git 
```

Then move into the new `gatsby-basics` folder

```
cd gatsby-basics
```

The master branch contains the final version of the project.

## Each Step of the Project Has a Branch

During the course we build out this project bit by bit.

Each step of the project has a corresponding branch with the same code I start with.

You can see all of the branches like this

```
git branch -a
```

To switch to a specific branch you can do this

```
git checkout BRANCH-NAME
```

For example, to get the first branch you would run

```
git checkout 01-getting-setup
```
